<PRE>Hi there,
I recently checked wxWidgets as I wanted to start porting it, and I 
noticed there was a project on berlios I didn't know about...

I checked out the svn (quite huge) and tried to build, but the BeIDE 
proj files are not really handy. They don't scale, have to be changed 
to change the arch, don't work nice with svn (binary), and don't work 
at all with recent gcc (from oliver tappe) as cpp changed its syntax 
and BeIDE screws up.

I managed to finally get the lib built with different devkits (one gcc 
to compile and the older one to link...) but it's not handy.

I wrote a makefile.beos to make things easier, see the diff.
There is no real reason to not use configure generated makefiles 
though, just have to fix it to include the gui stuff. But I guess it's 
ok for now.

I also had to change some stuff to build under Zeta... gcc didn't like 
casting int32 to int&amp;, and the FamilyAndStyle stuff is private in 
Dano... (it doesn't seem like the correct way anyway, should probably 
use font_which and face stuff).
Also, the absolute symlinks might work on your own box, but not on 
everyone's.

See
<A HREF="http://revolf.free.fr/beos/patches/wxBeos.diff.001.txt">http://revolf.free.fr/beos/patches/wxBeos.diff.001.txt</A>

I didn't dig much more, it'd be likely better to update to the current 
version first anyway.

Fran&#231;ois.

</PRE>
