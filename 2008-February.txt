Subject: [Wxbeos-devtalk] zeta fixes & makefile.
Message-ID: <19245047388-BeMail@laptop>

Hi there,
I recently checked wxWidgets as I wanted to start porting it, and I 
noticed there was a project on berlios I didn't know about...

I checked out the svn (quite huge) and tried to build, but the BeIDE 
proj files are not really handy. They don't scale, have to be changed 
to change the arch, don't work nice with svn (binary), and don't work 
at all with recent gcc (from oliver tappe) as cpp changed its syntax 
and BeIDE screws up.

I managed to finally get the lib built with different devkits (one gcc 
to compile and the older one to link...) but it's not handy.

I wrote a makefile.beos to make things easier, see the diff.
There is no real reason to not use configure generated makefiles 
though, just have to fix it to include the gui stuff. But I guess it's 
ok for now.

I also had to change some stuff to build under Zeta... gcc didn't like 
casting int32 to int&, and the FamilyAndStyle stuff is private in 
Dano... (it doesn't seem like the correct way anyway, should probably 
use font_which and face stuff).
Also, the absolute symlinks might work on your own box, but not on 
everyone's.

See
http://revolf.free.fr/beos/patches/wxBeos.diff.001.txt

I didn't dig much more, it'd be likely better to update to the current 
version first anyway.

Fran?ois.

Hi Fran?ois,

thanks for you work!
You are right. The first thing on our scedule was to add makefiles.
At this time now.. everything in the repository are from Anton.
He did all the work.

All Teammembers are higly motivated but most of them dont have so much time.

So if you want to join i can easly add you to the developerlist if you want.
(I know you are already registered on berlios mmu_man 
<https://developer.berlios.de/users/mmu_man/> ;-) )

I must konfess this is my first patch i aplly so i dont know if 
everything went right.
Would be great if you can check it.

God Bless
Paradoxon aka Matthias

Seems ok mostly, except the makefile.beos, you seem to have applied the 
patch 3 times, making the file have 3 times the same content, and it 
also has DOS CR-LF.
